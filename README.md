# balrog

Balrog calculates the line broadening of atomic spectra given certain plasma conditions. 
This code includes removes a number of approximations currently used by the line-shape community and is arguably the most advanced line-shape code available. 
The code reads in atomic data from atomic structure code, such as Cowan's atomic physics code, and then calculates collision T-matrices (collision amplitudes) which are then used to calculate electron broadening widths. 
The calculation of the collision T-matrices is the primary function of Balrog. These T-matrices are then read in by an auxiliary code to calculate a spectrum. The results of the Balrog code can be used to analyze astrophysical plasmas, as well as laboratory plasmas generated by the US national laboratories.
